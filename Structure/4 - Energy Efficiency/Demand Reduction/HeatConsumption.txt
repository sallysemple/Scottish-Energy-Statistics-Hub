<p>Reducing heat demand is a key priority identified in the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/heat-policy-statement-towards-decarbonising-heat-maximising-opportunities-scotland/">Scottish Government Heat Policy Statement</a> published in 2015.</p>
<p>Non-electrical <strong>heat demand </strong>follows a similar pattern to electricity; consumption steadily <strong>declined, dropping </strong>by <strong>19.1% </strong>to <strong>75.9&nbsp;TWh </strong>from <strong>2005-07</strong> to <strong>2021</strong>. This decline may be a result of improved energy efficiency, improvements in the building stock, rising gas prices and rising temperatures.&nbsp; This is a <strong>1.8% increase </strong>from <strong>2020.</strong></p>
<p>There is an aim published in the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> to <strong>reduce domestic</strong> heat demand by <strong>15%</strong> and <strong>non-domestic</strong> heat demand by <strong>20%</strong> between <strong>2015 </strong>and <strong>2032</strong>. &nbsp;However, non-electrical heat demand has <strong>increased</strong> slightly from <strong>2015</strong>, up by <strong>1.2%</strong>, driven by the <strong>domestic</strong> (<strong>5.4%</strong> increase) rather than the <strong>non-domestic</strong> sector (<strong>1.8%</strong> decrease). This may be explained by lower gas and oil prices and unseasonal weather conditions.</p>
