<p>For energy supplies to remain secure, the system must be able to meet <strong>demand </strong>at <strong>peak times</strong>. Hence <strong>seasonality </strong>is key as demand is <strong>higher </strong>in the <strong>winter </strong>than the <strong>summer</strong>. The chart illustrates this, showing Scotland&rsquo;s energy use on a daily basis from 2013. It shows that <strong>seasonal variations </strong>in the demand for <strong>electricity </strong>are much <strong>smaller </strong>than they are for <strong>gas</strong>.</p>
<p>This year, the peak daily demand for <strong>gas</strong> was <strong>285GWh </strong>(on 8<sup>th</sup> March 2023). This was more than twenty five times greater than the minimum daily demand of <strong>11GWh </strong>(on 20<sup>th</sup> October 2023). The peak daily demand for <strong>electricity</strong> was <strong>90GWh </strong>(on 9<sup>th</sup> March 2023). This was double the minimum demand&nbsp; of <strong>45GWh</strong> (on 1<sup>st</sup> July 2023). The <strong>peak half-hourly demand</strong> for <strong>electricity</strong> was <strong>4.8 GW</strong> at 5:30pm on 9<sup>th</sup> March 2023.</p>
