<p>Scottish consumers have been&nbsp;<strong>increasingly monitoring</strong>&nbsp;their&nbsp;<strong>energy usage</strong>&nbsp;in the last ten years.&nbsp; According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-house-condition-survey-2021-key-findings/pages/4-energy-perceptions/">Scottish House Condition Survey</a>, the proportion that say they&nbsp;<strong>closely monitor</strong>&nbsp;their&nbsp;<strong>energy usage</strong>&nbsp;has&nbsp;<strong>increased</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>44%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2008</strong> to <strong>61%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2021</strong>.</p>
<p>The UK Government required supply companies to offer&nbsp;<strong>smart meters&nbsp;</strong>to their customers to enable them to monitor their energy usage. Data from Electralink suggests that as of&nbsp;<strong>September 2023</strong>, over&nbsp;<strong>1.73 million </strong>smart meters were installed in Scotland, representing <strong>61.4%</strong>&nbsp;of all meters in Scotland. This is up from&nbsp;<strong>9.7%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>November 2016</strong>.&nbsp; Smart meter installations slowed from March 2020 and April 2021 as a result of COVID restrictions, but have picked up since.</p>
<p>Greater progress has been made in the smart meter rollout in South Scotland compared to North Scotland &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>66.9%</strong>&nbsp;of all&nbsp;<strong>South Scotland</strong>&nbsp;meters have been installed compared to&nbsp;<strong>46.8%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>North Scotland</strong>.&nbsp; This may be a consequence of the fact that North Scotland is more sparsely populated than South Scotland, meaning that installing a large number of meters in North Scotland is more challenging.</p>
<p>There is evidence to suggest that having a smart meter can make consumers&nbsp;<strong>more aware</strong>&nbsp;of their&nbsp;<strong>energy use</strong>&nbsp;and make energy saving changes as a consequence.&nbsp; According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/consumer-survey-2019">Ofgem&rsquo;s Consumer Engagement Survey</a>, of Scottish consumers that have a smart meter, almost six in ten (<strong>58%</strong>) say they&nbsp;<strong>monitor their energy use more closely</strong>&nbsp;and they encourage others in the household to&nbsp;<strong>use less energy.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
