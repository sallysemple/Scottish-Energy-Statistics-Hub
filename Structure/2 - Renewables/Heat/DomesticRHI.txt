<p>The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is a UK Government scheme set up to encourage uptake of renewable heat technologies amongst householders, communities and businesses through financial incentives. The domestic scheme launched in April 2014 and closed to new applicants in March 2022.</p>
<p>By <strong>March 2023</strong>, there was a cumulative total of <strong>20,914 </strong>accredited domestic RHI applications in Scotland. This is <strong>18%</strong> of all accredited domestic applications in GB. More than half (<strong>67%</strong>) of accredited applications were for <strong>air source heat pumps</strong> and just under a fifth (<strong>18%</strong>) were for <strong>bi</strong><strong>omass</strong> systems. The majority (<strong>86%</strong>) of full accreditations are for buildings <strong>off the gas grid</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scotland has <strong>1.7 TWh</strong> of heat paid for under the domestic scheme as of <strong>March 2023</strong>.</p>
